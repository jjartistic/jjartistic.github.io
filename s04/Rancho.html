        <img class="rounded-circle float-right" src="RMS.jpg" width="350 px">
        <p id="p"> Rancho san Joaquin Middle School is a very prestigious environment set to make brilliant students. It is located
            at 4861 Michealson Drive, Irvine, California. With more than 300 students for only 2 grades, this school has
            everything to fit your needs. For starters, most schools don't have a track, 10 basketball quarts, 6 volleyball
            quarts, 2 tennis quarts and a gym! Also Rancho has a strict "Be Kind to Others" program that helps many people
            communicate with each other. Another strict policy that they have is the RULES policy. The R: Respect, U: Unwavering 
            Integrity, L: Leadership, E: Effort, and S: Social Responsibility. I believe that Rancho is a good school because 
            there are many people you can converse with and be friends with. Since there are so many people At the school, there 
            are many different personalities that might be just right for you.

        <img class=" rounded-circle float-left" src="Mike Modeer.jpg" width="150 px">
        <p id="p">
            Principal Mike Modeer is one of the best that there is. He helps with all of your problems when nessasary and does his best
            to make the school one of the best environments to learn challenging subjects. Many people regard Rancho one
            of the top schools because of all of the hard work that Mr. Modeer and the vice principal, Jeff Morano, does.
            The Mr. Modeer and Mr. Morano keep everything in check and if it wasn't for the parntners then, Rancho
            would fall to ashes. So I really beilive that Mr. Modeer and Mr. Morano are doing a huge favor to us and we 
            should thank them.
