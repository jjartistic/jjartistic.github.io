                    This kind-hearted boy is named Jason Cheung. I met him about 3 years ago from my older brother, Edward Jung. He has many
                    interests including piano, science, and math. I love to hang out with him and he always makes me smile. Being with
                    him is like being with a golden retriever. He is very playful, loves to eat, and is a big ball of happiness.

                    Erik Hwang is a funny and smart person. He can conquer any scientific problem that you give him and there is no limit to
                    his knowledge. I met him 5 years ago when we were in the same 2nd grade class. Some of his hobbies are watching anime,
                    playing anime games, and researching about science. He cheers me up and I think Erik is a really good friend.

                    Edward Jung is my generous and mature brother. I met and saw him the minute that I was born. He loves to play violin, V.S.
                    others in basketball, and loves reading adventure books. He always finds ways to make me happy when I feel down or need a 
                    hug. He always steps up to help me when I am in trouble and plays with me when I am bored. He is the best brother that
                    I could ever ask for and I love him!
