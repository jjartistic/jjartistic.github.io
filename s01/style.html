    Mind you it will be a complicated one. 
    Ok then you are going to take the challenge? Yes or No? If you said yes then carry on, if you send no then GET OUT 
    OF HERE! Here is the question: There was one person in the room with a knife at the point (3,8), another person in 
    the room with a candelstick at the point (5,4), another person in the room with a revolver at the point (-2, 5), 
    and another person in the room with a lead pipe at the point (10,1). Everyone agrees that the first person to enter
    the room other than them will die. The door is at the point (0,-6). Another person comes into the room and looks 
    at the scene. Who was the first one reach the newcomer and destroy him?
