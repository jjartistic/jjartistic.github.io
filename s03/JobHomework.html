        <img class="rounded-circle float-right" src="Finding Nemo Story Board.jpg" width = "350 px">
        <p id="p">For my dream job I would like to be the director of story board design in Pixar.
            I love making nothing into something and when I draw my ideas
            out and make a tale it seems that something magical has just appeared
            before me. I also love using my right side of the brain to work together
            with my group and make a fun novel for everyone to enjoy! I think it is the
            best job for me because I love making intriging tales about major
            themes like love, friendship, sadness, and other things like that. For 
            example, in the movie, Finding Nemo, Nemo and Marlin, Nemo's dad, scour 
            the whole Pacific Ocean looking for each other. In the next movie,
            Finding Dory, the story board makers use Nemo and Marlin's friendship
            with Dory to make the plot and the storyline. I really like that
            the Pixar Story designers really focus on one main motif for every
            story. Pixar is a really fascinating company and I would love to work
            there.

        <img class="rounded-circle float-left" src="Brian Fee.jpg" width = "350 px">
        <p id="p">Being a pixar story designer for  one of its most popular movies 
            has its ups and downs. However, I think that the benefits outweigh the 
            consequenses. You are well paid, and get to work with a group of the most
            astounding and talented people. Also, You create a movie that benefits 
            the life of the people around you. I love that Pixar brings out emotions 
            such as saddness in the movie Inside Out when Riley went back to her
            parents after running away. Or Happiness when Nemo was reunited with his 
            father in the movie Finding Nemo. A movie or story that makes us feel
            emotions is a movie that was skillfully planned and carried out. Pixar 
            is one of the few companies that can do that. One of the the people that 
            are good at making stories is named Brian Fee. He is an 
            American storyboard artist, prop designer, animator, producer, and film
            director and occasional voice director. He has played in Cars, Cars 2,
            Cars 3, WALL-E, and Monsters University. He is very talented and I would
            like to do the same jobs and be the same worker as him.
