        <p id="p">Cornell is an amazing college located in Ithaca, New York.
            Even though Cornell has all of the trappings of a traditional college 
            campus, The beautiful scenery is what most awes its visitors.
            This outstanding Ivy League School has stood long and strong to 
            train its little geniouses. Cornell is the 6th top school in the world
            and has about 22,000 students and 1600 professors. Although Cornell very hard
            to get into, once you do its teachings and lesson that you learn
            is priceless. 
        </p>
        <p id="p">Cornell has more than 90 fantastic majors for you to explore!
            Full of hardworking and dilligent students, Cornell has a very strong 
            reputation as one of the most prestigious schools in the world.
            One of their main majors is fine art and architecture. They have this fun and exciting 
            end of the year party that involves everyone having fun and rejoicing!
            I love that their main prospect in Cornell is to connect everyone together.
            "A friend is one that knows you as you are, understands where you have been,
            accepts what you have become, and still, gently allows you to grow." -Willam
            Shakespeare. this is one of my favorite quotes because it allows you to 
            understand that friendship is not just doing homework todether, but 
            understanding that your friend accepts you, wants you, and loves you,
            that is a true friend. The envirinment in Cornell allows you to make 
            many true friends that you will be connected to all of your life.
            When you are in the same major like art (for me) you are able to connect
            and fell right at home with one another. Art is the major that I want
            to go to Cornell with and the main thing about the university that I love,
            bond that everyone has together.

        <p id="p">
            One of the unique things that they did for their first years in the major of architecture is
            that they planned a huge project to all the students in the major. For their end of the year
            assignment they were asked to build a huge dragon that was made out of items in everyday life.
            The day that they presented the dragon to the school was called Dragon Day. another 
            one of the things that I like about Cornell is that they have a lot of awesome
            traditions.
