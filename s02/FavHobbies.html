    <h3>One of my favorite hobbies to do when I am bored is ART.</h3>
    <h4>The examples below are pictures of artworks that I want to do someday myself.</h4>
    <img src="Best Friend Jongkie.jpg" width = "320 px" >
    <p>The artwork above is called Best Friend</p> 
    <p>and the Artist's name is Jongkie. I feel</p> 
    <p>as if the artwork is telling you that</p> 
    <p>your best friend is all you need to feel</p> 
    <p>happiness. After all a man is usually</p>
    <p>a dog's best friend and vice versa.</p>
    <p>I love this deep watercolor artwork!</p>
    <img src="Jungkie.jpg" width = "320 px" >
    <p>The artwork above shows a moose with </p>
    <p>special antlers. It shows a girl and</p>
    <p>a boy that are playing in the woods.</p>
    <p>Instead of drawing the whole woods</p>
    <p>this artist drew one thing that lives</p>
    <p>inside the woods and drew that instead.</p>
    <p>I love this piece because it turns</p>
    <p>something simple into something amazing</p>
    <img src="John Pike.jpg" width = "320 px">
    <p>The artwork above was made by a man named</p>
    <p>John Pike. This piece is very serene and</p>
    <p>calm, and uses all of the watercolor</p>
    <p>tricks to make your artwork look better.</p>
    <p>The trees and the waterfallmixed together</p>
    <p>shows a beautiful scenery. Pike went</p>
    <p>one more step by adding a series a colors</p>
    <p>that were on the opposite side of the</p>
    <p>color wheel. This is a spectacular artwork.</p>
    <h3>One of my favorite hobbies to do when I am bored is ART.</h3>
    <h4>Another one of my favorite hobbies to do when ai am bored is play Sports</h4>
    <img src="Rugby.jpg" width = "320 px" >
    <p>This ultimate sport is also known as football.</p>
    <p>You use your hands and pass to one another.</p>
    <p>You can win by getting the most touchdowns</p>
    <p>compared to the other team. This is a fun</p>
    <p>game that really strains your legs and arms.</p>
    <p>It is really competetive and I love it!</p>
    <img src="Soccer.jpg" width = "320 px" >
    <p>This ultimate sport is also known as soccer.</p>
    <p>You use your feet and pass to one another.</p>
    <p>You can win by getting the most goals</p>
    <p>on the other team. This is a fun game</p>
    <p>that uses your legs. One thing in the</p>
    <p>game that you don't want to get are fouls.</p>
    <p>It is really competetive and I love it!</p>
    <img src="Baseball.jpg" width = "320 px">
    <p>This sport is a sport that mainly uses</p>
    <p>your arms and legs. You can win by </p>
    <p>having the most runs. A run is when</p>
    <p>you go around all four bases. A </p>
    <p>really good thing to get in baseball</p>
    <p>is a homerun. It is when one person</p>
    <p>hits the ball really hard and the</p>
    <p>person that hit it get around all four</p>
    <p>bases without getting tagged out. This</p>
    <p>game is really fun and exciting to play.</p>
    <h3>Finally, one of my most favorite hobbies is Reading</h3>
    <img src="Reading.jpeg" width="320 px">
    <p>Reading is the most easiest thing that</p>
    <p>you can do. All you have to do is pick</p>
    <p>up a book and read. When I am bored</p>
    <p>I usually go to my bed and read. It</p>
    <p>helps me calm down and my mind is</p>
    <p>refreshed. I love reading and I wish</p>
    <p>that everyone could enjoy reading as</p>
    <p>much as I do. Reading is my jam!!!</p>
    <h4>thank you for Reading!</h4>
